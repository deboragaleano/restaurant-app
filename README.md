# Restaurant Reviews App

This is a mobile-ready website for local restaurant reviews and information. The site focuses on responsive design, accessibility and offline use. 

## Installation

* Clone this repository: https://github.com/deboragaleano/restaurant-app.git 
* In a terminal, check the version of Python you have:  `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with  `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`  (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use  `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's  [website](https://www.python.org/)  to download and install the software.
* Note - For Windows systems, Python 3.x is installed as  `python`  by default. To start a Python 3.x server, you can simply enter  `python -m http.server 8000`.
* With your server running, visit the site:  `http://localhost:8000`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.
